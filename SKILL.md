# Living in Truth

A skill for identifying and refusing the small ritual capitulations that sustain unjust systems - the everyday lies whose accumulation creates the atmosphere of oppression.

## When to Use

- When you recognize participation in institutional dishonesty
- When small compromises have accumulated into complicity
- When systems depend on your performed belief
- When you want to model authentic existence for others

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
### Step 1: Phase 1: Identify the Lies

Recognize what you're expected to perform:
- Statements you must make but don't believe
- Rituals of agreement you must enact
- Silences that function as assent
- Participation that legitimizes
- Pretenses of belief, enthusiasm, or loyalty

The greengrocer's sign is never just a sign. What is your sign?

### Step 2: Phase 2: Trace the Function

Understand why the ritual matters:
- Who benefits from your performed belief?
- What would happen if everyone refused?
- How does your participation enable others' participation?
- What message does your compliance send to witnesses?

The small lie is never small. It creates the world in which larger lies are possible.

### Step 3: Phase 3: Assess the Costs

Be honest about consequences:
- What will you lose by refusing?
- What risks do you face?
- Who else might be affected?
- Can you bear the consequences?

Living in truth is not free. Havel spent years in prison. You must count the cost.

### Step 4: Phase 4: Find Your Refusal

Identify the specific action:
- What specifically will you stop doing?
- What will you say or not say?
- What meeting will you not attend?
- What document will you not sign?
- What slogan will you not display?

The refusal must be concrete, not abstract commitment to honesty.

### Step 5: Phase 5: Prepare for Aftermath

Anticipate and plan:
- How will the system respond?
- How will you explain your refusal?
- Who might support you?
- What escalation is possible?
- Where is your line?

### Step 6: Phase 6: Act and Witness

Take the action and observe:
- Follow through on your specific refusal
- Note how others respond
- Document your own experience
- Be available to others who might be inspired
- Don't proselytize - let the refusal speak

## Output Format

A living-in-truth analysis including:
1. The system and its expected performances
2. Specific lies/rituals you're expected to perform
3. Their function in sustaining the system
4. Cost assessment of refusal
5. Your specific planned refusal
6. Aftermath preparation

## Constraints

- This is not about small personal preferences
- Genuine risk is involved - don't romanticize
- Others may not follow your example
- Systems can absorb individual refusals
- Living in truth may be lonely

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input**: Analyze participation in corporate culture that contradicts stated values

**Output**:
"System: Corporation claiming environmental commitment while pursuing harmful practices. Expected performances: Attend sustainability initiatives without noting hypocrisy, use approved language ('net-zero journey'), stay silent when discrepancies raised. Function: Employee participation legitimizes claims; silence is assent. Costs: Career risk, social isolation, possible termination. Specific refusal: At next all-hands meeting, when sustainability achievements are celebrated, I will ask publicly about [specific contradiction]. Aftermath: Document the response, connect with others who've noticed, prepare for performance review consequences."

## Integration

Works with:
- **parallel-polis**: After living in truth, build alternatives
- **moral-responsibility**: Foundation for refusing to outsource responsibility
- **structural-critique**: Understanding the system you're refusing to support
